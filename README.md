# Peng-et-al-2023-causal-relationship-between-early-life-growth-and-puberty-timing
We used MR approaches to examine the causal relationships between birth weight, childhood body mass index, and puberty timing and the potential mediating role of childhood body mass index in the causal pathway.

## Environment details
R package to generate results as per Peng et al,. 2023, Deciphering the causal relationship between early-life growth and puberty timing: a Mendelian randomization study

## Analysis steps
1.Data pre-processing for birth weight and childhood body mass index and puberty timing.

2.Two-sampe MR: exposure: birth weight or childhood body mass index; outcome: puberty timing.

3.Two-step MR: exposure: birth weight; outcome: puberty timing; mediator: adulthood BMI.

4.MVMR: exposure: birth weight and childhood body mass index; outcome: puberty timing.

5.MR-Cluster: exposure: birth weight; outcome: puberty timing.

## Data sources
Data for birth weight and childhood body mass index can be found at the following website: EGG Consortium http://egg-consortium.org/. Full summary data on puberty timing can be obtained from ReproGen Consortium https://reprogen.org/data_download.html.
